# Sorting_Visualizer-project
front-end project vizualizing various sorting algorithms

while running these project pls follow up these guidelines :
1. randomize the distribution of bars as you want
2. whenever you have started a sort dont randomize it again or use any other sorting first let it complete first otherwise it will not get sorted completely and properly.This can also be achieved by disabling every other button untill a sort gets completed.
3. heap sort is yet to be implemented although that is also not too tough write the algorithm whenevr a swap or rearrangement of no's occurs reset the bars legth hange the color and wait accordingly to make it observable.

further improvements:
1. speed control and size of array can also be made user controlled.
2. analysis of algorithm can be done by comparing sorting time on same distribution.
3. worst , best cases can be checked and understood.
